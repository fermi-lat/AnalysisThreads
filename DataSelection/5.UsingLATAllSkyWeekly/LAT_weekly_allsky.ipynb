    "# Using Fermi-LAT All-sky Weekly Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Some types of data analyses lend themselves to the use of all-sky data files, rather than repeatedly downloading overlapping regions of sky for repeat analysis. Examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Light curves and spectra for a large number of sources, whether galactic, extragalactic, or both\n",
    "* Characterization of large-scale diffuse emission\n",
    "* Analysis of moving sources, like the Sun\n",
    "* Searches for transient events (like GRBs) that have an isotropic distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis thread describes how to generate an all-sky data set for use in other types of analysis. We will then create an exposure-corrected all-sky image as an example of how to use the weekly files."

The file for the current mission week will also be listed, even though the week may not yet be complete.\n",

Once you have downloaded data from the full sky, you will need to combine the files and filter out duplicate events.
