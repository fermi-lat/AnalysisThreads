    "[gtmktime](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/help/gtmktime.txt) also provides the ability to exclude periods when some event has negatively affected the quality of the LAT data. To do this, we select good time intervals (GTIs) by using a logical filter for any of the [quantities in the spacecraft file](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone_Data/LAT_Data_Columns.html#SpacecraftFile). Some possible quantities for filtering data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DATA_QUAL` - quality flag set by the LAT instrument team (1 = ok, 2 = waiting review, 3 = good with bad parts, 0 = bad)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `LAT_CONFIG` - instrument configuration (0 = not recommended for analysis, 1 = science configuration)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ROCK_ANGLE` - can be used to eliminate pointed observations from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**NOTE**: A history of the rocking profiles that have been used by the LAT can be found in the [SSC's LAT observations page.](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/observations/types/allsky/)"

Typically, setting the parameter to 1 is the best option. For GRB analysis, on the contrary, the parameter should be set to \">0\".\n",
