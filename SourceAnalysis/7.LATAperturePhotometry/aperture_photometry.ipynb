    "# Fermi LAT Aperture Photometry\n",
    "\n",
    "LAT light curves can be created in two different ways: either by using a likelihood analysis (see the [Likelihood](https://github.com/fermi-lat/AnalysisThreads/blob/master/SourceAnalysis/2.UnbinnedLikelihood/likelihood_tutorial.ipynb) and [Likelihood with Python tutorials](https://github.com/fermi-lat/AnalysisThreads/blob/master/SourceAnalysis/3.PythonLikelihood/python_tutorial.ipynb)) or through aperture photometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "A likelihood analysis is the more rigorous approach and offers the potential to reach greater sensitivity. It also leads to more accurate flux measurement, as backgrounds can be modeled out and more detailed source models can be applied. However, aperture photometry can also be useful; it provides a model independent measure of the flux, requires fewer analysis steps, and it is less computationally demanding. It also enables the use of short time bins whereas likelihood analysis requires that time bins contain sufficient photons for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that prior to working through this tutorial, you already have a familiarity with the concepts in the [LAT Data Preparation](https://github.com/fermi-lat/AnalysisThreads/blob/master/DataSelection/2.DataPreparation/data_preparation.ipynb) and [Data Exploration](https://github.com/fermi-lat/AnalysisThreads/blob/master/DataSelection/3.ExploreLATData/explore_latdata.ipynb) analysis threads. The basic steps for aperture photometry are described below. Although this is straightforward, there are several steps and so it may be convenient for them to be combined together into a script. An example of how this can be done is available in the [User Contributions](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/user/) area. You will also need to have the [FTOOLS](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/ftools_menu.html) software package installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below a light curve is created centered on 3C 279. A 1-degree radius aperture is used with an energy range of 100 MeV to 200 GeV for the first 6 months of the Fermi mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using these photon and spacecraft fits files obtained from the [LAT Data Server](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ssc/LAT/LATDataQuery.cgi):\n",

    "The [output XML file](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/data/AperturePhotometry/3C279_output_model.xml) from the likelihood analysis is an input for **gtsrcprob**, but should be modified so that no source name contains a space, or begins with a number. Now run **gtsrcprob** to generate probabilities that each event may originate from each of the four modeled sources (src_3C_279, src_3C_273, Galactic Diffuse, and Isotropic Diffuse). You may need to download the latest diffuse models prior to running **gtsrcprob**. All of the most up-to-date background models along with a description of the models are available [here](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/BackgroundModels.html).\n",
