    "\n",
    "1. **Make Subselections from the Event Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since there is computational overhead for each event associated with each diffuse component, it is useful to filter out any events that are not within the extraction region used for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make Counts Maps from the Event Files**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    By making simple FITS images, we can inspect our data and pick out obvious sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Download the latest diffuse models**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The recommended models for a normal point source analysis are `gll_iem_v07.fits` (a very large file) and `iso_P8R3_SOURCE_V3_v1.txt`. All of the background models along with a description of the models are available [here](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/BackgroundModels.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a Source Model XML File**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The source model XML file contains the various sources and their model parameters to be fit using the **gtlike** tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create a 3D Counts Cube**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The binned counts cube is used to reduce computation requirements in regions with large numbers of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Compute Livetimes**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Precomputing the livetime for the dataset speeds up the exposure calculation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compute Exposure Cube**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This accounts for exposure as a function of energy, based on the cuts made. The exposure map must be recomputed if any change is made to the data selection or binning.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Here the exposure calculation is applied to each of the sources described in the model.\n",

    "9. **Perform the Likelihood Fit**\n",

    "    Fitting the data to the model provides flux, errors, spectral indices, and other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Create a Model Map**\n",

With hundreds of sources, there are too many free parameters to gain a good spectral fit. It is advisable to revise these values so that only sources near your source of interest, or very bright source, have all spectral parameters free. Farther away, you can fix the spectral form and free only the normalization parameter (or \"prefactor\").

We also use a limit of five degrees from the center of the search region (--free_radius 5.0) to reduce the number of sources with free parameters.
