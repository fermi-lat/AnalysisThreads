    "However, for large time bins, analysis which includes bright background sources (such as the Galactic plane), and long time-baseline spectral and spatial analyses, a **binned** analysis is recommended.\n",

    "Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Make Subselections from the Event Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since there is computational overhead for each event associated with each diffuse component, it is useful to filter out any events that are not within the extraction region used for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make Counts Maps from the Event Files**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    By making simple FITS images, we can inspect our data and pick out obvious sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Download the latest diffuse models**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The recommended models for a normal point source analysis are `gll_iem_v07.fits` (a very large file) and `iso_P8R3_SOURCE_V3_v1.txt`. All of the background models along with a description of the models are available [here](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/BackgroundModels.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a Source Model XML File**\n",

    "    The source model XML file contains the various sources and their model parameters to be fit using the **gtlike** tool.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Compute the diffuse responses**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each event must have a separate response precomputed for each diffuse component in the source model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Make an Exposure Map**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is needed in order to analyze diffuse sources and derive absolute fluxes.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. **Perform the Likelihood Fit**\n",

[gtdiffrsp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fermi-lat/fermitools-fhelp/master/fhelp_files/gtdiffrsp.txt) will add one column to the event data file for each diffuse source. The diffuse response depends on the instrument response function (IRF), which must be in agreement with the selection of events, i.e. the event class and event type we are using in our analysis. In this case we are using the standard SOURCE class (`evclass=128`) and event type 3 (`FRONT+BACK`), so we should use the IRF `P8R3_SOURCE_V3` (which is the most commonly used in standard analysis).\n",

    "If the diffuse responses are not precomputed using [gtdiffrsp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fermi-lat/fermitools-fhelp/master/fhelp_files/gtdiffrsp.txt), then the [gtlike](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fermi-lat/fermitools-fhelp/master/fhelp_files/gtlike.txt) tool will compute them at runtime (during the next step).

These TS maps are created by moving a putative point source through a grid of locations on the sky and maximizing -log(likelihood) at each grid point, with the other, stronger, and presumably well-identified sources included in each fit.
